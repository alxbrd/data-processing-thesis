Python scripts for processing data in my thesis
======================

Each of the following files correspond to an experiment and more specifically:
-exp_compare_vs_Random.py : corresponds to the sanity check experiment where we validate that an evolutionary based approach outperforms the naive random search algorithm.
- exp_assign_time_budget.py : refers to the experimental comparison of surrogate models when assigning the same generations budget to the multi-objective optimisation algorithm.
- exp_assign_generations_budget.py : corresponds to the experimental comparison of surrogate models when assigning the same execution time budget to the multi-objective optimisation algorithm.
- exp_compare_MOEAs.py : produces the results for comparing the performance of various multi-objective evolutionary algorithms on the service composition optimisation problem.
